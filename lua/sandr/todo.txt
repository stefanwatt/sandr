<Insert> can toggle between inserting and overstriking
use that instead of <bs>

could use buffer local keymaps -> i suppose they work on command mode too
since nvim_get_current_buf prints the same buffer as in normal mode

first usage of sandr is fine, second one is bugged -> substitute command is messed up
this seems to fix it self sometimes on every other use

replace on enter
